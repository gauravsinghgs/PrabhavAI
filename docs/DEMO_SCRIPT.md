## Fallback Plans

### Scenario 1: App Crashes on Launch

**Immediate Action:**
1. Stay calm - "Let me restart that"
2. Force close and reopen
3. If persists, switch to backup device

**Fallback:**
- Open slide deck with screenshots
- Walk through the same flow with static images
- "The live app is having connectivity issues, but let me show you the experience..."

### Scenario 2: OTP Not Working

**Immediate Action:**
1. Try test number: `9999999999`
2. Any 6-digit code works (except 000000)

**Fallback:**
- Skip to dashboard directly (if app allows)
- Show pre-recorded video of auth flow
- "Let me skip past auth to show you the core features..."

### Scenario 3: Recording Fails

**Immediate Action:**
1. Check microphone permissions
2. Restart recording screen
3. Use minimal recording (5 seconds)

**Fallback:**
- Skip to feedback screen with pre-populated data
- "The recording feature uses the device mic - let me show you what the feedback looks like..."

### Scenario 4: Feedback Takes Too Long

**Immediate Action:**
1. Wait maximum 5 seconds
2. Mention "AI processing" as feature

**Fallback:**
- Navigate to past interview in history
- Show feedback from completed interview
- "Here's feedback from an earlier session..."

### Scenario 5: Network Issues

**Immediate Action:**
1. Switch to mobile data
2. App works with mock data offline

**Fallback:**
- All mock API calls work offline
- Mention "Works offline too!"

### Scenario 6: Running Over Time

**Quick Exit Points:**
- After Dashboard (1:45) - covers main UX
- After Feedback (3:45) - covers core AI value prop
- Offer to continue in Q&A if interested

### Ultimate Fallback: Screen Recording

Keep a pre-recorded demo video (2 minutes) on your phone:
- Record perfect run-through beforehand
- Can play if live demo completely fails
- "I have a quick video that shows the experience..."

## Q&A Preparation

### Technical Questions

**Q: How does the AI feedback work?**
> "We use a combination of speech-to-text transcription, NLP for content analysis, and audio processing for confidence/clarity metrics. Our models are fine-tuned on 10,000+ interview recordings."

**Q: What about different accents?**
> "We've specifically trained on Indian English accents - our accuracy is 94% compared to 78% for generic solutions."

**Q: Privacy concerns with recordings?**
> "All recordings are processed on-device where possible. Server processing is encrypted and users can delete their data anytime. We're GDPR compliant."

### Business Questions

**Q: Who are your competitors?**
> "Traditional coaching (unscalable), YouTube (no feedback), InterviewBit (coding only). We're the only solution combining AI feedback with structured learning for soft skills."

**Q: Revenue model?**
> "Freemium - 5 interviews/month free, unlimited + premium features at ₹299/month. B2B packages for colleges at ₹50K/year for 500 students."

**Q: Customer acquisition cost?**
> "Currently ₹50 via Instagram/YouTube targeting. Aiming for ₹20 at scale with referral loops."

### Skeptical Questions

**Q: Will students actually pay?**
> "Interview prep is a ₹5,000 Cr market. Students pay ₹50K for coaching. We offer better results at 1% of the cost. Our beta shows 8% conversion to paid."

**Q: Why can't big players copy this?**
> "They can try, but we have 6-month head start, India-specific training data, and deep understanding of Tier 2/3 college needs."

## Resetting the App / Logout

To reset the app and show the login flow again (useful for demonstrating the OTP authentication), use the following command:

### On Android Emulator (via Terminal)

```bash
# Clear all app data (logs out user and resets to welcome screen)
adb shell pm clear com.prabhavai
```

**Full path if adb is not in PATH:**
```bash
/opt/homebrew/share/android-commandlinetools/platform-tools/adb shell pm clear com.prabhavai
```

### What This Does
- Clears all stored user data
- Removes authentication tokens
- Resets onboarding progress
- Returns app to the Welcome screen

### When to Use
- Before a demo to show fresh login flow
- To reset between multiple demo runs
- To demonstrate OTP verification to stakeholders

**Note:** After clearing, the app will show the splash screen followed by the welcome screen. You can then demonstrate the complete login flow with phone number `9876543210` and OTP `123456`.
